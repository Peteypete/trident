(defn authorize
  "Authorizes a transaction `tx` ran by the user `uid`.

  Returns transaction data if successful, throws an exception otherwise.
  `authorizers` is the fully-qualified symbol of a var containing your
  authorization model, e.g. `'your.namespace/authorizers`:
  ```
  (ns your.namespace)

  (clojure.spec.alpha/def ::message
    (trident.util.datomic/ent-keys [:message/text :message/sender]))

  (def authorizers
    {[nil ::message]
     (fn [{:keys [uid eid datoms db-before db-after before after]}]
       (not-empty
         (datomic.client.api/q
           '[:find ?e :in $ ?e ?user :where [?e :message/sender ?user]]
           db-after eid [:user/uid uid])))})
  ```
  This value of `authorizers` will allow a user to create a message entity as
  long as they are listed as the sender of that message.

  `authorizers` is a map from entity \"signatures\" to authorizer functions. The
  authorizer function takes information about a single entity that was changed
  in the transaction, returning true if the change should be allowed. A
  transaction will be authorized only if each entity changed by the transaction
  is authorized by at least one authorizor function.

  The entity must also match the authorizor function's signature. A signature is
  a pair of specs that are matched by a particular entity before and after the
  transaction, respectively. `nil` means that the entity does not exist. So in
  the example, `[nil ::message]` means that the entity is being created (i.e.
  it didn't exist before the transaction) and that it has exactly two keys:
  `:message/text` and `:message/sender` (see [[trident.util.datomic/ent-keys]]).

  The authorizer function takes the following parameters:

   - `uid`: same as the `uid` passed to `authorize`. It should be the ID of the
     user making the transaction, or `nil` if the user is unauthenticated.

   - `eid`: the ID of the entity being authorized.

   - `datoms`: the datoms in `:tx-data` from the transaction result that belong
     to this entity.

   - `db-before` and `db-after`: same as in the transaction result.

   - `before` and `after`: the results of `pull`ing the entity before and after
     the transaction, respectively; or `nil` if the entity doesn't exist."

(defn handler
  "A ring handler for authorizing and running transactions.

  To use `handler`, you must include `:allow [trident.datomic-cloud.txauth/authorize
  ...]` in your `ion-config.edn` file.

  Parameters:
  - `conn`: a Datomic connection
  - `tx`: a Datomic transaction
  - `uid` and `authorizers`: see [[authorize]].
  - `allowed`: set of fully-qualified symbols, denoting transaction functions
    that the user is allowed to include in their transaction.

  If authorized, returns a ring response with the value of `:tempids` from the
  transaction result in the body (as EDN). Returns a 403 response otherwise.

  Datomic EIDs in the response are wrapped in a tagged literal, e.g. `123`
  becomes `#trident/eid \"123\"`. See [[trident.datascript/transact!]].
  `handler` assumes that any EIDs in `tx` are normal `long`s, not tagged
  literals. To this end, you may want to include `{trident/eid
  trident.util/parse-int}` in your `data_readers.clj` file."
